# Next.js Member Listing App
Welcome to my first Next.js project! This is a simple application to display a list of members, their details, and includes basic navigation and a custom 404 page.

## ‚ú® Features
* Homepage: A welcoming page with a mission and vision statement.
* About Us: Information about our fictional company, NetLink.Inc.
* Member Listing: Fetches and displays a list of members from a placeholder API.
* Member Details: Click on a member to view their individual details.
* Custom 404 Page: A friendly page for when a route isn't found, redirecting back to the homepage.
* Responsive Design: Styled with CSS modules and global styles for a clean look.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
* Next.js: The React framework for production.
* React: For building the user interface.
* CSS Modules: For component-specific styling.
* Global CSS: For application-wide styles.
